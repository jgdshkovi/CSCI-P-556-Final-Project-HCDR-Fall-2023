## Home Credit Default Risk Analysis
#### Python, Sklearn, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter tuning, TensorFlow

- Designed and optimized an advanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using back-propagation and gradient descent,
achieving a crucial 68.26% test accuracy, contributing to Home Creditâ€™s lending strategy refinement.
- Employed feature selection techniques like grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning,
enhancing the Deep Learning model to achieve a test F1 score (0.7311) and a public score (0.7537).
- Executed a varied ensemble strategy with Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost via stacking. Integrated a deep
learning algorithm, boosting predictive accuracy by 10%.
